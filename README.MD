<div align="center"><h1>AREX API Service</h1></div>

## Introduction

This repository serves as the backbone for AREX's frontend, offering a comprehensive collection of API interfaces necessary for seamless user interface interaction and functionality.

## API Documentation

To ensure easy accessibility and understanding of our API interfaces, we utilize Swagger 3. This tool helps in generating clear and interactive documentation. You can view the API documentation by deploying the project and visiting: `http://[your-deployed-ip-and-port]/swagger-ui/index.html`. A visual glimpse of our Swagger UI is provided below for reference.
